Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness, and I'm like, what the heck did I just see? 😅 I mean, there were moments of total brilliance followed by complete randomness. Seriously, it's one of those  s that keeps you on your toes but also leaves you scratching your head.

> So, the cinematography was pretty dope, not gonna lie. Some shots were like visual poetry. The way they played with light and shadows, wow, you gotta hand it to them. But then the plot... it’s like they had a great idea and then just tossed bits of it in the air and hoped it'd land nicely. 

You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something and feel like, halfway through, you gotta Google the ending just to see if it’s worth finishing? Yeah, exactly that vibe. But then again, some scenes were so deep, you can’t help but think you’re missing out if you bail early. It made me think it was high time I actually 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   instead of relying on these sketchy 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮s lol. Maybe I've been doing it wrong this whole time.

And the characters! They’re all over the place emotionally. One minute they're in love, the next they're enemies, whispering darkness or something overly dramatic like that. It’s hilarious, though, how they manage to skip over some backstories and leave you wanting more but give you none of it. 😅 You know what I mean? It’s like they want you to use your imagination, but I need some direction here!

In-between all the chaos, I couldn't help but think of all the directors who trot out the “this is my artistic vision” line. But hey, maybe I’m just a sucker for tidy endings and a little context. You know how it is, sometimes I just wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and not work so hard, haha.

So randomly now, if (ptr) { func1(); } else { func2(); } — don't ask why I even typed that, moving on...

Anyway, it was a trip! Would I sit through it again? Maybe, if only for the crazy visuals and to see if I missed some profound message the first time. Or maybe it's one of those just-for-the-ride things. Who knows? Okay, I'm rambling now, but catch it when you’ve got time to spare and nothing to lose. 🤷‍♂️
